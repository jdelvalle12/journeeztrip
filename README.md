# Journeeztrip

## Description

Many people travel to many parts of the world everyday, and some of them are first time solo travelers,
but they get overwhelmed with all the information that is out there, about where to go, where to stay,
where to eat, what to do, etc. This app aims to ease those nerves for first time travelers in the most
simplistic way by providing information and tips as well as share their experience with other solo travelers
and a way to document their experiences.
